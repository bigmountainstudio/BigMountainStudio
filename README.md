# Hi, I'm Mark Moeykens
I created Big Mountain Studio when I started my YouTube channel and started published programming videos.

Now I create **picture books**.

# Did you say "picture books"?
Ha ha, yeah! ðŸ˜‚

I am a visual learner and when I am trying to find a solution, I can remember pictures faster than remembering a bunch of code.

So I created picture books like this free SwiftUI picture book: 
# SwiftUI Views Quick Start

## I like to teach concepts with pictures:

## And I like to teach code with pictures too:

## Pictures or Videos on every page:

# Learn 10X Faster
*...it's probably the best book on a programming topic I've ever read. I was intrigued by your "PowerPoint" style of teaching and now I'm all in. I can learn topics 10x faster because you're just showing me and telling me exactly what I need to know.*
*Phenomenal work!*
